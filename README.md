 #100 days  challenge
 here i will upload mi progress with the challenge 
 you can see the result in : [*https://codepen.io/federicoGuakinchay*](https://codepen.io/federicoGuakinchay)

 
In code.io the challenges are separated by days, but here we are going to group them so that each folder will have 10 days of the challenges (and I'm going to try to make  only 3 files for each folder , 1htm-1css-1js).
This is to make fewer files.
